lal_cuda
========

This Python package was developed for Dr. Rory Smith as part of the 2018A semester of the `ADACS <https://adacs.org.au/>`_ Software Support Program.  It provides several practical examples of how to use the GPU-accellerated version of the LALSuite LALSimulation package which was developed for this project.
