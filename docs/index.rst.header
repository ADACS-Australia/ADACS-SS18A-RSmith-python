lal_cuda
========

This Python package was developed by `ADACS <https://adacs.org.au/>`_ for Dr. Rory Smith as part of the 2018A semester of the ADACS Software Support Program.  It provides practical examples of how to use the GPU-accellerated version of the LALSuite LALSimulation package which was the focus of development for this project.
