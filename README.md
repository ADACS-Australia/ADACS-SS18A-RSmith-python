# lal_cuda

This project documents the work conducted by [Dr. Gregory Poole][1] for [ADACS][2] to develop a GPU-accellerated version of the LALSuite LALSimulation routines which generate model gravity wave waveforms for binary mergers of compact objects.  This work was conducted for Dr. Rory Smith of Monash University as part of the 2018A semester of the ADACS Software Support Program.

* For more details of this work, including a description of the speed-ups obtained, see the documentation for this project [here][3].
* This project also provides a Python package demonstrating the use of the ADACS GPU-accellerated version of LALSuite.
* To obtain a copy of the GPU accellerated version of LALSuite produced for this work, see [this link][4].
